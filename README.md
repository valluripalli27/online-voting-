The Online Voting System project was aimed at creating a secure and efficient platform for conducting elections and polls. The system had two types of users: admins and voters. Admins had the ability to create, manage, and monitor polls, while voters could participate in elections by casting their votes. This project focused primarily on the backend development, ensuring data security, smooth user interactions, and real-time result generation.
